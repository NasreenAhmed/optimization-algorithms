Direct Methods rely soley on the objective function f. These methods are also called zero-order,black-box, pattern-search or derivative-free methods. 
Direct methods do not rely on derivative information to guide them toward a local minimum or identify when they have reached a local minimum. 
They use other criteria to choose the next search direction and to judge when they are converged.
